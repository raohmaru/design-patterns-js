# Decorator Pattern
Decorators offer the ability to add behaviour to existing classes in a system dynamically.
The idea is that the decoration itself isn't essential to the base functionality of the class,
otherwise it could be baked into the superclass itself.

Decorators can be used to modify existing systems where we wish to add additional features to objects
without the need to heavily modify the underlying code using them.

Promote code re-use.
