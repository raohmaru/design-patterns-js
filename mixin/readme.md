# Mixin Pattern
Mixins are classes which offer functionality that can be easily inherited by a sub-class or group of sub-classes for
the purpose of function re-use.

In JavaScript, we can look at inheriting from Mixins as a means of collecting functionality through extension.
Each new object we define has a prototype from which it can inherit further properties.
