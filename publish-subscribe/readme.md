# Publish/Subscribe (Event Aggregation)
The Publish/Subscribe pattern however uses a topic/event channel which sits between the objects wishing to receive notifications (subscribers) and the object firing the event (the publisher). This event system allows code to define application specific events which can pass custom arguments containing values needed by the subscriber. The idea here is to avoid dependencies between the subscriber and publisher.

A clear example is the event system as specified in W3C DOM. We can register event listener to any DOM element (such as "click" or "submit") and dispatch events using `dispatchEvent()`.
