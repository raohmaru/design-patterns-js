# Factory Pattern
The Factory pattern is another creational pattern concerned with the notion of creating objects.
Where it differs from the other patterns in its category is that it doesnâ€™t explicitly require us to use a constructor.
Instead, a Factory can provide a generic interface for creating objects, where we can specify the type of factory object
we wish to be created.
