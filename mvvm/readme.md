# Model View ViewModel Pattern
MVVM (Model View ViewModel) is an architectural pattern based on MVC and MVP, which attempts to more clearly separate
the development of user interfaces (UI) from that of the business logic and behavior in an application.
To this end, many implementations of this pattern make use of declarative data bindings to allow a separation of work
on Views from other layers.

This facilitates UI and development work occurring almost simultaneously within the same code base.
UI developers write bindings to the ViewModel within their document markup (HTML), where the Model and ViewModel
are maintained by developers working on the logic for the application.
